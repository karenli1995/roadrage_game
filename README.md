# game
First project for CompSci 308 Fall 2015

Name: Karen Li (kjl32)

Date started: Aug. 24

Date finished: Sept. 4

Hours worked: about 15

Resources used: I went off of a BrickBreaker example that I found as an example NetBeans JavaFX example. They allow for the manipulation of their code by copyright. I've included their copyright information in my code, but I also created my own classes on top of them, while modifying almost all of their code to create my game. I mainly used their example as a structure to build off of for my game.

Main class file: Main.java

Data (non Java) files needed: 
image files

How to play the game: Using the left, right, up, down arrow keys, navigate the water buffalo safely across the roads without hitting the oncoming traffic. You have 3 lives, and once you lose all 3 lives, you lose the game. Pass all 4 levels to win the game.

Keys/Mouse input: up, down, left, right arrow keys

Cheat Keys: Press "A" to pass a level automatically. 

Known bugs: Cannot restart the game. Also no splash page to declare that you have won the game. Water Buffalo must go past the end of the screen to pass a level (just didn't have time to change coordinates)

Extra features: none

Impressions/Suggestions: I enjoyed this project as an introduction to JavaFX. It helped me really learn the APIs and functions of JavaFX, though it was a bit time consuming and I wish I had had more time to work on my game, because bugs still exist.
