Genre: Puzzle game
Name: Road Rage 
Goal: Cross the road from one end to another without colliding with cars
Basic Mechanics: It's based off of the game, Frogger. I am slightly modifying the game to a different theme. Influenced by my summer trip to India, the character of my game will be a water buffalo instead of a frog, and it will attempt to cross the congested roads of India.
Levels: I will have different types of automobiles, including autos, motorcycles, and rickshaws. Each automobile runs at a different speed. Each level will contain a different combination of automobiles. As the player passes each level, the speed of the automobiles will increase, and there will be more instances of each vehicle.
